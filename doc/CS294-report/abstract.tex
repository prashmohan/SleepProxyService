    Today's computers run at very low utilization rates, while still consuming up a big part of the peak power rating. This report analyzes high performance computing clusters with different approaches to putting nodes to sleep in order to save energy without adversely affecting the user experience. We present ``Clean Clusters'', a software suite containing building blocks for power aware job schedulers. By performing detailed analysis of the ``Clean Clusters'' suite on a real hardware and applying the overheads on real world HPC traces, we model a performance-energy tradeoff equation which can be readily used by  system administrators.
